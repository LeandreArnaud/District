## Backend API (Alpha)
For now, the 
<span style="color:red">**backend API is private**</span>
and is restricted to a single city. Also it doesn't use a database at this point.<br/>
I need to improve secutity on it (I don't want you to ruin all my GCP credits). <br/>
However, the code is available on 
[this repo](https://github.com/LeandreArnaud/District_backend) 
so you can deploy yours easily.<br/><br/>
