# DISTRICT App

A mobile app made to train firefighters to learn their district (streetnames, apartments, hydrants.. etc)
<br/><br/>

## Backend API (Alpha)
For now, the 
<span style="color:red">**backend API is private**</span> 
because we need to implement an authentification functionality (I don't want you to ruin all my GCP credits). But you can create yours:<br/>
The **MVP backend** (limited to one city) will be available on my github soon !!
